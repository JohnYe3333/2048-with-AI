# 2048 with AI

This is a Java implementation of the popular game 2048, including a **Swing GUI**, an **AI component**, and an **AI benchmark utility**. The AI uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to determine the best move. You can use the AI benchmark component to test the AI and gather statistics on its performance.
